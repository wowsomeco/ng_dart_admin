## 0.0.1

Initial Version of the library. Use it at your own risk!
It's meant to be used internally for now (No Unit Tests, Documentations, etc. just yet)

## 0.0.1+2
  * w_table can handle edit, add, as well as delete item, still WIP though.

## 0.0.1+3
  * added collapsible directive.
  * added w_list which is useful for generating collapsible nested list, accordion, etc.

## 0.0.1+4
  * separated w-table into w-table and w-action-table, where w-table is useful only for showing the table data, while w-action-table has form adapter that can be used to show the form dialog to add new / edit item.

## 0.0.1+6
  * revamped w-select, so now it has [adapter] input that can be used to fetchOptions asynchronously.
